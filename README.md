# Comedysportz Website
Welcome to the README file for the OPHS Comedy Sportz website. 

This file should tell you evetything you need to know about maintaining and updating this website, as I don't want it to become obselete the moment I leave. 

## Changing Pictures
Let's kick it off with changing the site's pictures. You probably want to keep these (somewhat) up to date, as it's kind of wierd to show graduated players on the site. Anyway, if you want to change the pictures, it's pretty easy to do so. The steps are as follows:

1) **Open up the "Images" folder to the left.**
2) **Delete the images in there**
3) **Convert all of your images to .JPG (and compress them as far as you're willing, to speed up loading times) and rename them "csz1.JPG", "csz2.JPG", etc... all the way to "csz6.JPG"**
4) **Now put these new renamed images into the "Images" folder.**
5) **Click "Run" at the top**
